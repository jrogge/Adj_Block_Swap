\section{Intro}

\begin{mot}
    You have a PDF but it's reversed! You can only move the pages by
    designating a range of pages and moving them to a specified location.
\end{mot}

\begin{op}
    Given a list, you may designate a range and a point in that range (between
    values) and the blocks on either side are (rigidly) swapped.
    Notation:
    \begin{align*}
        \mid_0 1 \mid_1 2 \mid_2 3 \mid_3 \ldots \mid_{n-1} n \mid_n
    \end{align*}
    Denote a swap of the range $a,c$ about point $b$ (s.t. $a < b < c$) by
    $[a,b,c]$.
\end{op}

\begin{prob}
    If the list is reversed, what is the optimal sequence of swaps to sort it?
\end{prob}
A clear upper bound is $n-1$: the sequence of swaps $s_i = [1, i-1, i]$ (for
$1 \le i < n$) reverses the list. Is this the best we can do?

\begin{q}
    If we permute the swaps above by some permutation $\sigma \in S_{n-1}$
    and associate to it the permutation defined on the reversal (so that
    $id \in S_{n-1}$ is sent to $id \in S_n$), what can we say about this map?
    It is certainly a map of sets $S_{n-1} \to S_n$ preserving the identity,
    but is it a group homomorphism? If so, what is the image?
\end{q}

\begin{q}
    In general, what is the best sorting algorithm using this operation?
\end{q}

\subsection{Duality}
Observe that if $\sigma$ is the reversing permutation $(n \ 1) (n-1 \ 2) \ldots$
then it is its own inverse. It is fixed under conjugation by itself and,
importantly, an operation of the type we are considering is sent to another
under conjugation by $\sigma$, so conjugation by $\sigma$ defines an involution
on the solution set. Call orbits of solutions under conjugation by $\sigma$
equivalence classes. Visually, this corresponds to flipping the entire
permutation. Algebraically an opertation $[a,b,c]$ on $n$ elements is sent
to $[n - c, n - b, n - a]$ (note the order).

\subsection{Almost symmetric optimal sequences}
No self-dual solutions have been found yet. However,
for $n =6$, there are two nicely symmetric solutions.
%Neither are
%precisely self-dual but they are almost self-dual.
\begin{align*}
    [[0, 3, 6], [0, 2, 4], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]\\
    [[0, 3, 6], [2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5], [0, 2, 4]]\\
    \\
    [[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5], [0, 1, 6]]\\
